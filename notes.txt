📱 Google’s Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A) – Quick Summary for Mobile Users

- Smarter Assistant Collaboration:
  Multiple AI agents on your phone can now work together.
  Example: Plan a trip across calendar, maps, and browser apps—all from one command.

- Seamless Multi-Step Tasks:
  Say “book dinner and a ride,” and different agents handle each part without app-hopping.

- Faster, Context-Aware Responses:
  Agents share context instantly, leading to quicker, smarter replies on mobile.

- Better Privacy by Design:
  Each agent accesses only what it needs—reducing data sharing across apps/tasks.

- Multi-Modal Interaction:
  Works with voice, text, and touch—agents collaborate behind the scenes no matter how you interact.

- Persistent Background Tasks:
  Agents can manage ongoing workflows (e.g., deliveries, event planning) without constant input.

Summary:
A2A makes mobile AI feel more like a coordinated team—faster, smarter, and safer for everyday users.
